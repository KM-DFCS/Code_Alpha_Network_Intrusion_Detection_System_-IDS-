# Code_Alpha_Network_Intrusion_Detection_System_-IDS-
# This project focused on setting up and configuring an IDS using Snort or Suricata on a Windows machine. Custom rules were created to detect threats like port scans and DDoS attacks. Simulated attacks were performed using tools like Nmap and hping3 to test the systemâ€™s effectiveness. Logs and alerts were analyzed, and optional visualization with ELK Stack provided deeper insights. Deliverables included configuration files, logs, and a detailed report.
# In conclusion, this project enhanced practical skills in network threat detection and response, emphasizing the critical role of IDS in maintaining network security.
